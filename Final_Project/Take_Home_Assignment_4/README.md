# Final Project Take Home Assignment 4

## Goals
- Make a Github repo for your project
- Learning how to make circuit diagrams
- Learning how to make system block diagrams

## Deliverable
The deliverable for this assignment will be a link to the Github Repo that you will make.

## Github Repo
✏️Create a Github Repo for your project. Make sure there is a README markdown file (It does not need to contain anything yet), a folder named src that will eventually contain all your code files and libraries, and a folder named Documentation where you will save your Circuit Diagram and System Diagram. 

## Circuit Diagrams

Download and install KiCAD [here.](https://www.kicad.org/download/) KiCAD is a free and open source software suite for electronic design automation (EDA). Go through Tutorial Part 1: Project and Tutorial Part 2: Schematic at this [link.](https://docs.kicad.org/9.0/en/getting_started_in_kicad/getting_started_in_kicad.html) 

✏️Once you have read through the tutorials use KiCAD to make a circuit diagram of your project. Save your schematic file in the Documentation folder of your Repo.

## System Block Diagram

System block diagrams for embedded systems are useful for giving a graphical representation of how all the components of your system work and flow together. This [article](https://embeddedhash.in/embedded-systems-block-diagram/) gives a good example of a generic block diagram for an embedded system. Things to make sure to include in your block diagram are:
- Sensors and Inputs
- Microcontrollers
- Power
- Actuators and Outputs
- ADCs and DACs
- Manual or Human inputs

✏️Make a simple system block diagram of your device. Your block diagram does not need to be an in-depth representation of your device. Make sure it includes anything that is in the list above. [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/), [Inkscape](inkscape.org), or other similar drawing software are useful for making block diagrams. Save your block diagram in the Documentation folder of your repo.
