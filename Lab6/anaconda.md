# Install Python Environment
We will use Python for signal process in this Lab. If you are not familiar with Python, please follow the steps to prepare Python workspace. Detailed instruction on Python is beyond the scope of this lab, but it is recommended to explore more on Python, as it can be very useful in your future courses.

1. Install Anaconda - If you do not have Python on your computer. Install Anaconda on your computer. Anaconda is a useful tool to manage Python environments and modules. Please also refer to this starter tutorial for Anaconda. 
1. Prepare a Python Environment
    - Open Anaconda Navigator  
    - Go to ‘Environment’ page, click ‘Create’ to create a new Python environment. It is recommended to have a new Python environment for a new project to avoid conflict of Python modules.
    - Install Python module ‘numpy’, which is a popular powerful scientific computing module for Python. In Box 1, make sure you select the environment you just created. In Box 2, check ‘not installed’. In Box 3, enter ‘numpy’. In Box 4, check the module ‘numpy’. 
 
Similarly, enter ‘matplotlib’ and check it. This is a module for data visualization. 
 
Then, enter ‘pyserial’ and check it. This is a module to read the sensor signal that Arduino passes to USB serial 
 
Finally, click ‘Apply’ at the bottom right corner.
•	Install Spyder
Spyder is a Python IDE (Integrated development environment), which is a interface to write and test Python scripts. There are many different IDE for Python. You can choose your own favorite, but we will use Spyder as an example. To install Spyder, go to ‘Home’ page and select the environment you just created, then click ‘Install’ under Spyder.
 
•	To test if the Python environment is ready to go, open ‘test_environment.py’ in Spyder and run it. It should show a plot and raise no error.
