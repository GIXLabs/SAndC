# Benchtop Power Supply
Benchtop power supplies allow you to try your circuits out with a flexible and reliable power supply. They also feature some safety features, like current limiting, that can save your electronics if something goes wrong.

## Setting up Your Power Supply
First, plug in your power supply. There is a socket on the back for the power cable. It is polarized, so you do not have to worry about plugging it in the wrong way.

Now we need to attach some wires to get power to your circuit. This image shows banana plugs leading into the power supply and alligator clamps on the other end.

**Safety Note:** Be careful with the ends of these wires. Connecting them together while powered (also called shorting), creates a circuit with 0 resistance. That's bad because it results in a theoretically infinite current, regardless of your voltage. In this circumstance, the current limiting will activate and the power supply will stop delivering current. If it happens with your projects, you will likely fry your project, set a fire, or destroy a battery.

## Voltage
We can set the voltage of the supply by adjusting each digit of the voltage (see below). The power supply starts off in V-Set mode for setting the voltage, but if you find it is editing the current instead, press the V-Set button.

## Current
The current is set in the same way as the voltage, but you will need to press the I-Set button to switch to edit the current. I is the commonly-used symbol for current.
