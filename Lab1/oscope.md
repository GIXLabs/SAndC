# Using an Oscilloscope
## Turning on the Oscilloscope
There is a power socket on the back for a power cable, much like that on the benchtop power supply. Once you have plugged that in, press the power button in the bottom left corner of the oscilloscope. The oscilloscope takes a minute or two to boot up.

## Connecting Probes
Once the oscilloscope is on, you should connect your probe(s) to the BNC connectors along the bottom. When positioned right, they slide in without effort and twist to lock in place. Please be gentle with your probes. They are precision instruments and should be treated that way.

Many probes come with an option to reduce the voltage of the incoming signal to reduce the chance of damaging the oscilloscope. To activate that feature, slide the switch on the probe to "10X."

You will also need to tell the oscilloscope that you are using a 10x probe.

## Calibrating Oscilloscope Probes
Clip the probe and ground to their appropriate hooks on the bottom right side of the oscilloscope.

Using a flat-head screwdriver, adjust the screw until the wave has a square top. You may need to press the Autoset button if you do not see the signal and you may need to scale the display so you can see the wave better (see Adjusting the Display section for more details).
