## Power Supply and Multimeter
- Draw a diagram of the setup to read DC voltage with a multimeter.
- Set your power supply to 4.75 V and 1 A, then verify with your multimeter. Take a picture of your setup.
- Draw a diagram of the setup to read DC current with a multimeter.
- Measure the DC current through a 1k ohm resistor, with your power supply set to 4.75 V and 1 A. Use the A plug on the multimeter, which is the one on the far left side. Take a picture of your results.
## Oscilloscope and Function Generator
- Take a picture of your uncalibrated probes on the oscilloscope, then another once you have calibrated them.
- With the load set to "High Z," generate a ramp wave shape, with peak-to-peak amplitude of 2.5 V, minimum voltage at 0.0V, and frequency set to 100kHz. With the Horizontal Scale set to 4 micro-sec per capture. Take a screenshot of the wave on your oscilloscope.
  - Count the number of positive peaks on the screen and explain why you get the number you get.
  - Read and record the peak-to-peak amplitude and minimum voltage.
  - Set the horizontal scale to 1 micro-sec per division and repeat the previous two steps.
