# Assignment
## Power Supply and Multimeter
1. Draw a diagram of the setup to read DC voltage with a multimeter.
1. Set your power supply to 4.75 V and 1 A, then verify with your multimeter. Take a picture of your setup.
1. Draw a diagram of the setup to read DC current with a multimeter.
1. Measure the DC current through a 1k ohm resistor, with your power supply set to 4.75 V and 1 A. Use the A plug on the multimeter, which is the one on the far left side. Take a picture of your results.
## Oscilloscope and Function Generator
1. Take a picture of your uncalibrated probes on the oscilloscope, then another once you have calibrated them.
1. With the load set to "High Z," generate a ramp wave shape, with peak-to-peak amplitude of 2.5 V, minimum voltage at 0.0V, and frequency set to 100kHz. With the Horizontal Scale set to 4 micro-sec per capture. Take a screenshot of the wave on your oscilloscope.
  1. Count the number of positive peaks on the screen and explain why you get the number you get.
  1. Read and record the peak-to-peak amplitude and minimum voltage.
  1. Set the horizontal scale to 1 micro-sec per division and repeat the previous two steps.
