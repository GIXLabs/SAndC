# Using a Signal Generator/Function Generator
## Setting up with BNC to BNC Cables
With a BNC to BNC connector, connect the Channel Output on the signal generator to the appropriate probe input on your oscilloscope. Make sure you change your oscilloscope input back down to 1x when connected directly to the signal generator.

## Setting up with BNC to Clip Cables
With a BNC to clip connector, connect one end to the Channel Output on the Signal generator and use the clips to connect to your circuit. In this example, we are using a 47 Ohm resistor. Frequently you will use a setup like this with an oscilloscope (see the [oscilloscope article](/oscope.md) for an example).

## Changing Mode (high Z)
To use the signal generator with an oscilloscope, you should set the Load Impedance to "High Z" mode. Make sure that the input on your oscilloscope is also set to 1X when connected with the signal generator. You can also set the load to whatever your load is using the number pad.

## Changing the Waveform
To change the waveform, press the button along the bottom of the display that corresponds with the waveform you would like.

## Adjusting Frequency
From the main menu, use the buttons on the right side of the display to select "Frequency/Period/Phase Menu." It is not a touch screen.

## Adjusting Amplitude (Vmax and Vmin)
There are a few ways to adjust the amplitude (voltage) of the signal, but the most intuitive is to adjust the minimum and maximum voltage.
